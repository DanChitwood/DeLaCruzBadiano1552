**Medicine to ease pain in the throat.** The liquor of the small herbs [tlanexti](Tlanextia_xiuhtontli.md) and [teo-iztac-quilitl](Teo-iztaquilitl.md), that grow in stony places, crushed in honey with red and white earth, reduces pain in the throat, if lightly rubbed on with a finger inserted into the mouth.
