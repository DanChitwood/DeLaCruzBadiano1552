## Subchapter 8a  
**Curation of the pubis.** When this part feels pain, let it be anointed with liquor expressed and prepared from the bark and leaves of the tree[macpal-xochitl](Macpal-xochitl.md), the thorny plants [tolohua-xihuitl](Tolohua xihuitl.md) and [xiuh-tontli](Xiuhtontli.md), Indian knives, flints, the fruit we call [te-tzapotl](Te-tzapotl.md) and the stone [te-xoxoctli](te-xoxoctli.md), ground up in the blood of a swallow, a lizard and a mouse. You must remember to heat this liquid. Also if a tumor or the pain burns severely, do not hesitate on section; the cut you must purify and anoint with a liquid drawn from the roots of the herb [tlal-huaxin](Tlal-huaxin.md), ground up in yolk of egg.
