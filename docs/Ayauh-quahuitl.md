## Subchapter 8f  
**Gout.** One with gout can be cured in this way: the bush [piltzin-tecouh-xochitl](Piltzinte-couh-xochitl.md), the leaves of the cypress and laurel, are thrown in an ants’ ditch where ants go to and fro, or are sprinkled as a lotion. Then the leaves of the bush [quappo-quietl](Quappo-quietl.md), leaves and bark of the [ayauh-quahuitl](Ayauh-quahuitl.md), leaves of the [quetzal-mizquitl](Quetzal-misquitl.md), tla-que quetzal and [tepe-chian](Tepe-chian.md), the flowers of any plant, a small white or red stone, the plant called [itzquin-patli](Itzquin-patli.md), pine, an oyster shell ground up in hare’s blood, small foxes, serpentine rabbits (? for burrowing moles), [eca-cohuatl](eca-cohuatl.md), lizards; pearl, greenstone and bloodstone are to be ground up in water. If the foot is troubled with much heat, let it be soaked in the cold liquor; if it is chilled over the instep, it is to be heated. To the above named you also add a yellow-colored flint, and the flesh and excrement of a fox, which you must burn to a crisp.

This then stays for a day and a night, when the [huitz-quahuitl](Huitz-quahuitl.md) wood, with a red juice, is added as coloring. Also the blood of wild animals, namely the red ocelot, [cuetlachtli](cuetlachtli.md), [miztli](miztli.md), [ocotochtli](ocotochtli.md), white ocelot, [tlaco-ocelotl](tlaco-ocelotl.md), is sought for.

As for the rest, let whoever wishes to follow through this reinvigoration of the body, eat other things also, but as of chief value the flesh of the white rabbit or white fox, either baked or boiled.
