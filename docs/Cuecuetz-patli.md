## Subchapter 9h  
**For recurrent disease.** Let one relapsing in sickness drink, before a meal, a little of the latex like milk, expressed from the [teo-amatl](Teo-amatl.md), that he may vomit. On the third or fourth day let him drink a potion formed from [tonatiuh-yxiuh](Tonatiuh_yxiuh_v1.md) root, [tlatlanquaye](Tlatlanquaye.md) and also [tlanexti-yxiuh](Tlanextia-yxiuh.md) root, ground up in tepid water. Third let him drink of the [cuecuetz-patli](Cuecuetz-patli.md) root crushed in our wine. Let him drink this as he enters the bath, and then on coming out be anointed with the liquor of ground [teo-amatl](Teo-amatl.md) roots. The bowel should be twice cleared with a clyster, first with a liquor from [ohua-xocoyolin](Ohua-xoxocoyolin.md)root crushed in hot water, and this even though he partakes of some food; this healthful juice will throw out pus from the abdomen. The second time, a few days later, made of the intoxicating plant we call [piciyetl](Piciyetl.md), salt, our black pepper, and light colored pepper.
