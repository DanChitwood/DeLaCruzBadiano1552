**Support for one crossing a stream or water.** For one who wishes to cross a river or water safely, moisten his chest with the juice of the plants [yyauhtli](Quauh-yyauhtli.md) and tepepapalo quilitl, crushed in water. In his hand let him carry a beryl, the head and viscera of an oyster, a sardonyx and the eyes of a large fish shut tight in his mouth.
