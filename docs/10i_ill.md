**Lice on the head.** The medicament for this is the root of the bush [zozoyatic](Zozoyatic.md)ground in water of bitter taste, the herb [iztauhyatl](Iztauyattl.md), the fat of a goose, the incinerated head of a mouse, the twigs removed from a swallow’s nest, all which you must then triturate, and pour the medicament over the head.
