The above are to be heated and used for anointing. Let her eat the cooked flesh of a wolf, and greenstone together with bright green pearl be bound on her back. She may also drink the juice of ground up kite and goose flesh, and the tail of the tlaquauzin, in our sweet wine; also take the root of the [xal-tomatl](Xal-tomatl.md), the tail of the [tlaquatzin](tlaquatzin.md), and leaves of the [cihua-patli](Cihua-patli.md), grind them up, and wet the womb.
