Variants: te-xiyotl  

## Subchapter 6c  
**For swollen jaws.** Swollen jaws are helped by taking in water the juice of crushed [tememetla](Te-memetla.md) leaves, the pith of the [te-xiyotl](Te-xiyotl.md) and white earth, the liquor whereof is sub-acid, with the gummy twigs bearing the glutinous tears we call [nocheztli](Nocheztli.md). For those who cannot open the mouth the root of the [tlatlacotic](Tlatlacotic.md) crushed in tepid water helps greatly; if he drinks this liquor, making him promptly vomit, the freed mucus will open the mouth.
