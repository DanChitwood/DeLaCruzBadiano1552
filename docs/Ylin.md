## Subchapter 9o  
**Dyspepsia, or difficult digestion.** When any one by reason of overloading the stomach becomes constipated, give him cypress nuts, laurel leaves, the root of the plant [zaca-matlalin](Zaca-matlalin.md), the bark of the blackberry bush, the cherry and the [ylin](Ylin.md) tree, with the root of the [tonatiuh-yxiuh](Tonatiuh_yxiuh_v1.md), which is red as bright gold. Then crushed together in acid water let them be boiled with honey; the liquor drunk aids wonderfully in clearing the bowels.
