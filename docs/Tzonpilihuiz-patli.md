## Subchapter 6h  
**For dropsy.** The water under the skin is to come out by cutting, and all purulence cleared out; this done, the leaves of bramble bushes and the [tzonpilihuiz-patli](Tzonpilihuiz-patli.md) are macerated and boiled in water with white frankincense, adding Indian wine. The medicine thus prepared is to be forthwith injected into the putrescent part, which is then covered up.
