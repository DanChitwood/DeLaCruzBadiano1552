## Subchapter 8f  
**Gout.** One with gout can be cured in this way: the bush [piltzin-tecouh-xochitl](Piltzinte-couh-xochitl.md), the leaves of the cypress and laurel, are thrown in an ants’ ditch where ants go to and fro, or are sprinkled as a lotion. Then the leaves of the bush [quappo-quietl](Quappo-quietl.md), leaves and bark of the [ayauh-quahuitl](Ayauh-quahuitl.md), leaves of the [quetzal-mizquitl](Quetzal-misquitl.md), tla-que quetzal and [tepe-chian](Tepe-chian.md), the flowers of any plant, a small white or red stone, the plant called [itzquin-patli](Itzquin-patli.md), pine, an oyster shell ground up in hare’s blood, small foxes, serpentine rabbits (? for burrowing moles), [eca-cohuatl](eca-cohuatl.md), lizards; pearl, greenstone and bloodstone are to be ground up in water. If the foot is troubled with much heat, let it be soaked in the cold liquor; if it is chilled over the instep, it is to be heated. To the above named you also add a yellow-colored flint, and the flesh and excrement of a fox, which you must burn to a crisp.

## Subchapter 9m  
**Festered places with worms.** When you see a festered spot gathering worms, grind together the leaves of the [quetzal-mizquitl](Quetzal-misquitl.md), [cimatl](Cimatl.md), [tlal-cacapol](Tlal-cacapol.md)and bramble bushes; also the root of the [tlaquilin](Tlaquilin.md) and the bark of the [xilo-xochitl](Xilo-xochitl.md), and put into our best wine; apply the liquor to the affected spot morning and evening. It will also be well to apply a medicament from bramble bushes, oak bark and leaves of the [quetzal-ylin](Quetzal-ylin.md), [tlal-patli](Tlal-patli.md), [quauh-patli](Quauh-patli.md), and [tlatlanquaye](Tlatlanquaye.md), with the [tlal-ahuehuetl](Tlal-ahuehuetl.md) root, ground up in water with yolk of egg. Use this twice daily, morning and evening, that purulence may dry up.
