# DeLaCruzBadiano1552

Preliminary website for analysis of the de la Cruz-Badiano codex of 1552

## Code and data  
All scripts to reproduce these analyses are found in `./analysis/scripts/`. Data to reproduce these analyses are found in `./analysis/data/`. The folders `./analysis/data/leaf_traces/`, `./analysis/data/texts/`, and `./analysis/data/texts_ES/` (leaf trace data and English and Spanish texts, respectively) will need to be unzipped before using. The FastText English and Spanish models `cc.en.300.bin` and `cc.es.300.bin` will need to be downloaded from this [link](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html) and placed into `./analysis/data/`. The pages of the document from which leaf traces are derived and on which they are plotted are derived from the public version of [The De la Cruz-Badiano Aztec Herbal of 1552](https://archive.org/details/aztec-herbal-of-1552) and the exact images found on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29825189.v1) should be downloaded, the .zip file decompressed, and saved as the folder `pics` in `./analysis/data/`.
